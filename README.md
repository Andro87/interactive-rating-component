### What I learned

This project is part of the [Introduction to web accessibility](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/introduction-to-web-accessibility-mXu-9PHVsd) learning path on the Frontend Mentor platform.
It has helped me to gain a better understanding of accessibility best practices and key concepts in this area.
I aim to continue expanding my knowledge in this crucial field and ensure that the websites I work on are accessible to everyone.
